- 👋 Hi, I’m @JosephHughMurphy
- 👀 I’m interested in improving how we manage multiple data sources for the construction industry. I like to dabble in visualizing and mapping complexity for different industry problems to improve decision-making.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python (networks, data mining, and NLP), SQL, HTML, Java, and CSS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on visualizing complexity with network theory, mapping and coding requirements, interfaces, and file transformations.
